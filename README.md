# Facial-Expression-Recognition using Keras
With the use of Convoluted Neural Networks, OpenCv and Keras frameworks, a facial expression recognition system was developed to distinguish between the seven basic facial expression, namely anger, disgust, fear, happiness, neutral, sadness and surprise displayed by a character at different points on a video feed. The dataset used was the FER 2013 dataset.
